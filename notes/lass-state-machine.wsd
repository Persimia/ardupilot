Pilot velocity control relative to dock. \n\

use pos control to hit pos vel target \n\
keep yaw pointed at obstacle

pitch set based on lead up \n\
roll, pitch, yaw rates to zero

relax the controllers to smoothly settle

disable crash checks \n\

State WindUp: \
pitch set based on reverse of lead up

send detach signal to mcu \n\

use pos control to get to safe distance

State Default: \
go to normal loiter code when nothing detected

abort state to escape blade
